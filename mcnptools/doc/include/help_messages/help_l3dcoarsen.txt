--jfact, -j       : Factor by which to coarsen in the second mesh dimension 
                    (if applicable) 

--kfact, -k       : Factor by which to coarsen in the third mesh dimension (if 
                    applicable) 

--maxmats, -m     : Maximum umber of materials to keep include on the 
                    coarsened LNK3DNT file (default: same as original) 

LNK3DNT           : LNK3DNT file name to coarsen 

OUTPUT            : coarsened LNK3DNT output name (Default: lnk3dnt.coarse)
